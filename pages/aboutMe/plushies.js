      In late-spring of 2024,
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a tool to turn any 3d model into a fabric pattern in Houdini.
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It'll show me the ammount of stretch in a design, let me label the panels, add notches to neighboring panels, and more!
      
      <br><span class="innerCenter">So I've been making plushies in my free time!</span>
      
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I started with anti-pil fleece fabric. I realized pretty quickly it gives off plooms of micro-plastics as you play with them; but its super easy to work with.
      <br><span class="innerCenter textSkew">Anti-pil fleece is definitely a hobbyist fabric.</span>
      
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I moved to minky, which is a bit more difficult to work with, but is so soft and cuddly!  It's a bit more expensive, has less stretch than anti-pil, but it's a much better fabric for the feel of the plushies.
      <br><span class="innerCenter textSkew">Minky is definitely for a more skilled crafter.</span>
      
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long run, I can get a idea from my head to a plushie in about 4 days now.  So I've been making a bunch of different designs, and I'm really happy with how they've been turning out!
