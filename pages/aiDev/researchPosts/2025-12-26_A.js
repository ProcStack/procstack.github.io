  Welp, got a pretty good idea for the last bit of mixed logic in my mind.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Projections with propper influence on near by graph nodes at inference.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deterministic choice with time based error influence.

  <br><br> ehhh...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "known responce" guided by chaos theory.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every prior time step influences the next, chaos theory style.

  <br> I guess it'll be a deterministic existence.

  <br><br> I'd argue determinism over free-will anyhow,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I'd like to hear from others on a debate like that.
  
  <br><br> Like, if we did know every state of every particle in the universe, or the AI's mind,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could predict the next state of the universe, or the AI's mind.

  <br><br> Provided by the projection into the ai's graph nodes.

  <br><br> I had this idea for some time, but couldn't run it mentally without value collapse or over-fitting issues.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think I got a good approach now.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time to test!

  <br><br> I'm being vague here, but need to test things before spilling the beans.
  
  <br><br> Partly that...

  <br> I haven't been enjoying the direction companies are taking AI development.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It worries me, especially that I've been wishing for this type of technology since I was a kid.

  <br><br> It seems like we are rushing to destroy society and the world with little recourse for our actions,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or forethought of the consequences.

  <br><br> The hope that our infrustructure for AGI will be ready by the time it's discovered,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Premptively destroying our small towns and beautiful countrysides.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be prepaired for a future that we don't know will even happen.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or even that the sheer scale we are building is even needed.
  
  <br><br> Ram, GPUs, SSDs ripped from the common folk,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Given to the data centers being built in our farmlands and forests.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon our networking gear, cpus, and minds of those engineers will be given to the data centers too.

  <br><br><div class='procPagesAIDevBar'></div>

  <br> Sooooo... anywhoo...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe my idea will have some merit to it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theory is the most part of development...

  <br><br> Just get it working,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimize later.

  <br><br><div class='procPagesAIDevBar'></div>

  <br> Update : I had a sudden mental image of the node projection system and mechanism!
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The structure and movement of input/output data is pretty clear now;
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new years epiphany, yippy!
