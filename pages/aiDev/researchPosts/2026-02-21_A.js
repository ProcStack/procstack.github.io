  I'm looking into Dostoevsky's story The Brothers Karamazov. I'll likely get the book, as it touches on multiple views of isolation's impact on psyche.

  <br><br> While researching the book some, I noticed something that seems to be rearing its head more and more these days.

  <br><br> The Id, Ego, and Super Ego of Society.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Albert Camus' The Stranger outlining internal struggle of self-alienation.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov breaking down moral structure, where self-alienation implodes.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Robert D. Putnam's Browling Alone to describe the collapse of community.

  <br><br> Each stand on their own, Camus and Dostoevsky follow each other in collapse of man.  Putnam explains the collapse of community as a sign of what individuals are enduring.

  <br><br> The inner self, local self, and broadcasted self.

  <br><br> We were warned by story,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then verified by sociology.

  <br><br> I feel we may be beyond the point of no return to a big social shift,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentalities need to form-fit much quicker than ever before,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't think our individual selves can handle this much adaptive-living at once.

  <br><br> Like a Farmer in the ER,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; We might say, "it's not so bad,"
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's likely life threatening...

  <br><br> Since the point of this blog is about ai development,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some parallels can be drawn,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mostly in societal perception.

  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it helpful?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Draining or tainting freshwater?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the power grid handle it?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it making jobs?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it just spoofing people online in images and video?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it used for deep fakes?

  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the moral standing around the existence and implementation of AI in our society?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it bringing us together or driving us apart?

  <br><br> <span class="textSquidge textItalic">Is it impacting <span class="textSquidge">Me?</span></span>

  <br><br> In the last 10 years, we've had a barrage of constant "stuff" happening in society.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Social shifts of the mid 10s, pandemic hitting for about 1.5 years, mis allocated funds during the pandemic caused a small bubble to pop in 2023/2024, while AI is surging in usage and hype-only promises, welcome to 1984.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon Fahrenheit 451 & the 2026/2027 social bubble pop.

  <br><br> Being a netrunner ripped from Neuromancer makes fiscal sense in the future we're headed.

  <br><br> Due to the lack of nuance during our forced, Camus inspired, Covid lockdowns,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-expression has started to become its own culture.
  <br>To stand up against the washing of our minds,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are moving away from the Internet Monoculture.

  <br><br> Resentment is growing between groups gatekeeping trivial interests from others,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a selfishness -or- hatred of the uniqueness is sturing.

  <br><br> Many want a micro-label,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm guilty of this too...
  <br> There is less of an outside "individual",
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the attempts to be novel misleads community.

  <br><br> Oh, Jujutsu Kaisen was your first anime? Pff, I started on Naruto!
  <div class="textRight">Yeah, well I started on Bleach.</div>
  <div class="textCenter">Ohhh, you're all children, I started on Berserk.</div>
  Try Dragon Ball, kids.
  <div class="textCenter">All of you pacifier suckers crawl back, I started on Astro Boy!</div>

  <br><br> We want people to adore us,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But not to change ourselves in the process.

  <br><br> "Jujutsu Kaisen, cool!  I love that show. What would your domain expansion be like?"

  <br><br> Like every good comedian,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textName">"Yes, and..."</span>

  <br><br><br> <span class="textDehydrated">For this blog entry's "No, but..." or "What about...",
  <br> I'm a technical artist, not a sociologist or psychologist.
  <br> I'm anecdotally inspired & read a couple books; hearsay.</span>

  <br><br> Is this what AI is going to fill in for?
  
  <br><br> If I believe so strongly that AI should be used interweaved with human determination,
  <br> Not implemented in a way to take desire from us,
  <br> But to support our endeavors for a future in harmony with ourselves,
  <br> ...
  <br> Then will AIs be the connective tissue between people living in solitude in the future?

  <br><br> Like WALL-E,
  <br> We sit in our chairs,
  <br> But in little closed off boxes,
  <br> Not mobile pods.

  <br><br> That's just depressing...
