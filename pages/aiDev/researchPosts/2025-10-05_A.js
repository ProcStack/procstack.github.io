  On the topic of nothingness and somethingness, Hegel started with what it means to Exist at all, before Being and Nothingness can have meaning.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That once something has a purpose beyond the innate attribute of existing, "Actuality" or running the class constructor, then the bounds of Being and Nothing can be defined.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to read more Hegel, he's one of the bigger names I haven't read as much of.

  <br><br> Something about that got me thinking about the big bang. 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something from nothing has been the running theory of the Universe with the Big Bang for some time now.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That there could be a source of creation beyond the wall between us and the void, simply by nature of how we exist within physics, rather than above physics.

  <br><br> If you zoom super far in, at planck length scales, there is a Quantum Foam, like frothing, that exists from these nano-blackholes popping in'n'out of existence.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There's plenty of speculation as to where it's source comes from, but it's mostly agreed its gravitational forces causing it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam</a> )
  
  <br><br>I'm dubious of this, siding with some theories from String Theory & M-Theory, vibrations from higher dimensions causing that bubbling to occur.  But String & M-Theory are still being worked out by people smarter than me.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I mostly think this cause of how electrons exist in duality as a particle and wave. As if they were a function of frequencies moving through space-time.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the representation of an electron might merely be a compounding wave interacting in space.
  
  <br><br> Keep in mind, I aint some fizzy-cyst, this is just an interest of mine.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I might have some things wrong.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you're interested, look into the Kaluza-Klein theory, and how it tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism through higher dimensions.  This lead into String Theory and M-Theory.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein_theory" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_theory</a> )

  <br>This foam acts as a perturbation to space around it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the "energy" in the void.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Something in Nothingness.

  <br><br> In my mind, it makes sense that these slight undulations in space could cause entropy to begin, if there was actual homeostasis in the early Universe.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there wasn't homeostasis, due to the different distributions of antimatter vs matter in the early Universe.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I wonder if the foam could have added to the early incendiary forces which lead to quarks forming into protons & neutrons, as electrons cooled down and the mass started to aggregate into atoms in early times.

  <br><br> I'm moithering a bit.

  <br><br> To Exist and Become in AI requires similar perturbations, noise patterns to shift AIs current understanding, stochastically shifting its 'ideas' for better perspectives on the data.

  <br><br> I've been calling these 'Lighthouses' for a while now.  They are the landmarks for a sense of reality for the AI itself.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; While I still feel like they shouldn't be required, most ai uses some form of stocastic noise pattern to help shift understanding of concepts while training or inference.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Learning AI that will use random/noise.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are deterministic ais, such as the chess playing Stockfish which doesn't use noise. But for AIs outside of planning and strategy, random is used.

  <br><br> Should that noise pattern be altered while it's being used as the Lighthouse, the current step of math and logic in that AI becomes corrupted.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; At least as far as I've seen.

  <br><br> AI's "being" is bound to its skewed perceptions.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... We all kinda are ...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But should an AI not have that noise-skew, the AI doesn't usually "become" anything of any usable behaviors.

  <br><br> ( Certain noise isn't that pivotal to "existence", but noise aids in the final AI becoming itself. )

  <br><br> I still don't like the idea of Lighthouses for AI.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But would I be stripping away the AI's personality for raw deterministic responses,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I find a way around Lighthouses?
