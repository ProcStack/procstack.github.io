  On the topic of nothingness and somethingness, Hegel started with what it means to exist at all, before Being and Nothingness can even have meaning.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That, once something has a purpose beyond simply existing as a formless entity,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It then has "Actuality", like running a class constructor in code,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Only after Actuality, can you define the bounds of Being and Nothing.
  
  <br><br> I need to read more Hegel, he's one of the bigger names I haven't read as much of.

  <br><br> Something about Actuality got me thinking of the Big Bang, and the moments just after. 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something from Nothing has been the running theory of the Universe with the Big Bang for some time now.  Because we don't really know where we came from.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That there could be a source of creation beyond the wall between us and the void, simply by nature of how we exist within physics, rather than above physics.

  <br><br> If you zoom-in super far, down to Planck Length scales, there might be a Quantum Foam, like frothing, proposed by John Wheeler.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That space-time isn't smooth, but bubbling with energy.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potentially from nano-blackholes.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potentially from virtual particles popping in'n'out of existence.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potentially from quantum gravitational warping.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There's plenty of speculation as to where it's source comes from, but mostly agreed its gravitational influence, if it exists at all.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam</a> )
  
  <br><br>I'm dubious of the gravitational warping, siding with some theories spawned from String Theory & M-Theory, vibrations from strings or potential higher dimensions causing that bubbling to occur.  But String & M-Theory are still being worked out by people smarter than me.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I mostly believe this cause of how electrons exist in duality as a particle and wave, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and other quantum effects.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But where's the source of the ephervesence? Is it only Higgs Field interactions?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's the Higgs Field come from?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Electrons act as if they are 'functions()' of frequencies moving through space-time.
  
  <br><br> All of this is still in hypothesis land though, so take it with a tacobell sauce packet.
  
  <br><br> Keep in mind, I aint some fizzy-cyst, this is just an interest of mine.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I make graphics for a living.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I might have some things wrong.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you're interested, look into the Kaluza-Klein theory, and how it tried to unify gravity and electromagnetism through higher dimensions.  This lead into String Theory and M-Theory.

  <br>This foam acts as a perturbation to space around it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the "energy" in the void.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Something in Nothingness.

  <br><br> In my mind, it makes sense that these slight undulations in space could cause entropy to cascade, if there was PERFECT homeostasis in the early Universe.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But there wasn't homeostasis, due to the different distributions of antimatter vs matter in the early Universe.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I wonder if the foam could have added to the early incendiary forces which lead to quarks forming into protons & neutrons, as electrons cooled down and the mass started to aggregate into atoms in early times.

  <br><br> I'm moithering a bit.

  <br><br> To Exist and Become in AI requires similar perturbations, using noise patterns to shift an AI's current understanding.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stochastically shifting back'n'forth trying to get better perspectives to understand 'ideas' from patterns.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing Algernon to see his reality better, while walking through Tensor Fields.
  <br> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon</a> )
  <br> <span class="textDrinkMeAlice">( I mostly picked this reference for the <span class="textSpoiler">meat-space over-fitting; Algernon got too smart and burnt out</span>.... <span class="textShrink">highlight for spoilers.</span>)</span>


  <br><br> I've been calling these 'Lighthouses' for a while now.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textShrink">I still don't know if there's an official term for them.</span>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the landmarks which give AI a sense of reality.
  
  <br><br> While I still feel like they shouldn't be required, most ai uses some form of stocastic noise pattern to help shift understanding of concepts while training, and sometimes inference.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Learning AI that will use random/noise,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ussually act as a Deterministic AI during inference/prediction.

  <br><br> Should that noise pattern be altered while it's being used as a/the Lighthouse, the current step of math and logic in that AI becomes corrupted.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; At least as far as I've seen in my tests.

  <br><br> AI's "being" is bound to its skewed perceptions.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... We all kinda are ...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But should an AI not have that noise-skew, the AI doesn't usually "become" anything of any usable behaviors.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lighthouses just work.

  <br><br> <span class="textShrink">( Certain noise isn't as pivotal to "existence", but noise aids in the final AI becoming itself. )</span>

  <br><br> I still don't like the idea of Lighthouses for AI.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But would I be stripping away the AI's personality for raw deterministic responses,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I find a way around Lighthouses?
