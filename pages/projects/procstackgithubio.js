    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It mostly has examples of pxlNav rooms and the page & content system I wrote!

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>It's funny, out of all the projects I can bootstrap together with my personal boilerplates over the years,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never built a single-page site system before this one!

    <br>
    <br>Maybe I should write a 'server-side' pre-render for this pages system,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn this into a proper package for others to use! haha

    <br>
    <br>I like vanilla javascript too much....
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a detriment realy, but I can't help it!

    <br>
    <br>So soooo many years using JS on its own,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Environments like React.js/Next.js, Svelte, Angular, etc. don't feel like as much fun as just writing it out myself, dang it!
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textItalic">Ragga fragga, get off my lawn ya dang kids!</span>
