  Which ever ya feel like calling me!

I'm a technical artist with years of film, XR, & immersive experience.

  This site is a show of my work.

Trancor is my pre-rendered graphics & diy builds,

ProcStack is coding & real-time graphics creations ('Trancor' was taken on github),

Kevin Edzenga is just ... Me.
