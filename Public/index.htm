                      <br><br><span class="gitPageHeaderStyle">What's <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span>?</span>

                      <br><br>Hit <span class="textBoldBox">P</span> on your keyboard to pause the background.
                      <br><br>Hit <span class="textBoldBox">Y</span> to open the <span class="textNudge">Shader Editor</span>.

                      <br><br>The background of this page is running '<span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span>',
                      <br>Javascript package to extend Three.js to make it more interactive / game like.
                      <br>Originally made for a virtual event space called "Antibody Club" [defunct] during 2020 Covid lockdowns.
                      
                      <br><br><span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> is a player controller + rendering set-up that brings more interactive functionality to Three.js.
                      <br>It's basically a wrapper for Three.js, using Three.js's renderer, character rig + animation features, to create something like a game engine... I guess.
                      
                      <br><br>You can use any 3d modeling software to make interactive environments called <span class="textName">Rooms</span>, making it a little easier to make games/interactive environments.
                      
                      <br><br>Lets say, in Maya or Blender, you make a scene, add extra User Detail attributes to your objects to tell <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> how to interact with them.
                      <br>Giving you the ability in your modeling software to set up-
                      <br>Teleporter colliders within scene or between <span class="textName">Rooms</span>, set item pick-ups, ground colliders, animated textures, and more set in your 3d modeling software of choice.
                      <br>For customized object coding in javascript, mark objects as 'isScripted' and you can easily access that specific object by name in code.
                      <br>Then <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> loads your FBX and acompanying javascript file as a <span class="textName">Room</span> that can be portal'ed to if ya wanted.

                      <br><br><span class="gitPageHeaderStyle">Origin</span>

                      <br><br>Antibody Club was a site we hosted virtual events, album releases, dj sets, and holiday parties available on any web browser and mobile.
                      <br><img src='https://www.pxlmancer.com/show/Antib0dyClub_10_chatImplemented.jpg' class='gitPageImageStyle' alt='Antibody Club'>
                      <span class="imageDesc innerCenter">Antibody Club [defunct] - Showing some of the, now removed, network features.
                      <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vzqZ2sNjaw" target="_blank">See Antib0dy.Club in action <span class="textDrinkMeAlice">[YouTube]</span></a></span>

                      <br><br>Since then, society walked back into the sun and stretched their legs a bit,
                      <br>The needs for a virtual event space had waned.
                      
                      <br><br>However, pxlNav was pretty cool, so I decided to make it easier to install for your own Three.js projects.
                      <br>Aiming to turn your 3d modeling software into a level editor.

                      <br><br>As it stands, pxlNav supports FBX files for your Rooms (the environment / scene / levels) which can be made in your 3D program of choice.
                      <br>It supports rig + animation fbx files for your character animation, and a simple curve in your scene can act as your camera path ( add another if you want the camera to look somewhere as it's traveling the path ).
                      <br>Animated textures by using a second texture, particle effects, FPS navigation, obstacles, items, portals, and more.

                      <br><br>3d for web has come a far way, and it has less hurdles than getting your game ready for cross platform usability.
                      <br>Websites are just there, anywhere, and can be turned into apps easily these days.
                      <br>So why not?

                      <br><br>--

                      <br><br>During the run of Antibody Club (2020), I did have a helping hand on a couple shaders, camera animations, and some other odds'n'ends. Much of which has been altered since, but thanks none-the-less!
                      <br>So, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention <span class="textNudge">Michael Lee</span> & <span class="textNudge">Charles Wang</span> for helping on Antibody Club / pxlNav.

                      <br>  Eyyyyy, check out pxlNav!  I guess this repo is more of an example of using pxlNav before I get it tightened up for public use.

                      <br><br><a href='https://github.com/ProcStack/procPromo_ShaderPack' target='_blank'>procPromo Minecraft Shader Pack</a>
                      <br>A shader pack written for Minecraft, used through Optifine.
                      <br>For the pack, I developed depth based smart texture bluring, in attempts to capture the Minecraft Key or Promo art used when new updates are released.
                      
                      <br><br>This included developing a edge detection system using depths & surface nornals saved through differed buffers, where the actual edge detection is performed on a final render pass.
                      
                      <br>Having also wrote a shadow distortion & bias system as well.  Having never written a shadow shader before, or the subsequent position projections from ever shader that would sample the shadow buffer, I wrote a simple radial distortion, distance based from the player.  However there were shadow scalping everywhere.
                      <br>Circular shadow projections, in a cubic game based around 90 degree angles.
                      <br>I then wrote a per-axis distortion system with biasing based on distance from camera.
                      <br>This allowed for sharp crisp shadow edges on blocks, but also with the distance based biasing, solved a lot of depth based issues.
                      <br>Allowing me to create a shadow with little to know peter panning, little scalping, edges on surfaces parallel to the suns directional rays, all at great distances from camera.

                      <br>Originally written in Python for PyGame, decided it would be a fun project to learn C++ on.

                      <br>Letting them write the very words written in the tome perched upon the desk.
                      <br>A segmenter, labeler, and scripting language was written to allow saving individual characters, variants, and written pages, with text effects like opacity, scale, and kearning.

                      <br><br>It changes every couple'a years, never quite getting to a state of being “done,” yet always a shotgun blast of different dev work.

                      <br>All of which can be saved to a pxlm file, to maintain your layers, settings, pallet swatches, and all!
                      <br>Sadly, an update in javascript broke saving images, and I haven't had the time to fix it yet...
                      <br>You can still save your document to a pxlm file, and open it back up to continue working with it!

                      <br><span class="textNudge">Effects</span> (volume sims, particles, and some RBDs) on <span class="textName">Ice Age 4</span>. 
                      <br>Along with 5 years of <span class="textNudge">Crowds</span> development/navigation/sims in Houdini for <span class="textName">Ferdinand</span>, <span class="textName">Rio 2</span>, <span class="textName">Peanuts</span>, <span class="textName">Ice Age 5</span>, & <span class="textName">Spies In Disguise</span>.
                      <br>Being part of 2 published Siggraph papers and got an opportunity to speak at <span class="textBump">Siggraph</span> to a bunch'a peoples about camera based crowd navigation for <span class="textName">Peanuts</span>.
                    
                      <br><br>After that was <span class="textBump">Antib0dy.Club</span> / <span class="textBump">pxlNav</span>, then a couple non-pxlNav virtual events, including a St. Jude + GCX virtual fundraiser.
                      <br>Then some xr/immersive reality work; like a couple official Instagram filters and 3 Home Environments for Oculus, among a few other things.

                      <br><br><span class="imageDesc">I recently made a tool that can turn any 3d model into fabric patterns in Houdini,</span>

                      <br><span class="imageDesc">So I've been making custom plushies in my free time.</span>

                      <br><br>Outside of that, I'm on'n'off working on <span class="textNudge">Graph Attention Networks</span>.
                      <br>I made a generic/multi-purpose neuron I'm getting to figure out when and where-to each are connected.
                      <br>Rather than a grid of numbers aligning to yield a prediction, it's a data structure which outputs a value due to the neuron connections.
                      <br>Realistically, the output should be similar to a RNN, but with a different mental structure.
                      
                      <br><br>...Mostly they are used for "<span class="textNudge">Recommendation Systems</span>",
                      <br><span class="textItalicBox">Hey, you might know <span class="textNudge">Jim Bob McGee</span>!!</span>
                      <br>But could be used for so much more!

                      <br><span class="imageDesc">So all this new AI stuff has been quite serendipitous for me!</span>
                      <img src='https://www.pxlmancer.com/show/esnLearning.gif' class='gitPageImageStyle' alt='Frank the Fish on his Pinky Flamingotube!' >
                      <span class="imageDesc innerCenter">Not a graph network, but an ESN (a RNN variant) I wrote to detect & predict motion.
                      <br>Upper left are some videos I made, upper right are it's 'levels' of learning R-G-B,
                      <br>The bottom two are slices of what the brain is seeing, and then predicting.</span>

                      <br><br>There has been some advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but not quite what I'm looking for in how the neurons are structured, or that I've seen yet.
                      <br>Intrinsic learning dang it! That meta-learning to help with the learning of the learning!
                      
                      <br><br>Eh, I'm rambling now...
