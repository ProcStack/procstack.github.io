There is something to be said about the path AI has been going on since the mid-late 2010s.
<br>
<br>This isn't about the data scraping or privacy issues, much of that was a wash because of internet law set back in the 90s.
<br>We walked into our data being scraped, and legally at that.
<br>It's just morally questionable.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

I'd like to comment on the path we are taking with AI.
<br>I just don't think Transformers and U-Nets are the end-all be-all of it,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd imagine rightfully so, since we are pretty early on here.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where ai Agents come in, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_of_experts" target="_blank" alt="Mixture of Experts">Mixture of Experts</a> (MoE).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fill the gaps.
<br>
<br>The network type and model for General Intelligence
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the new "Super Intelligence" just hasn't been found/developed yet.
<br>
<br>We are currently banking on statistical predictive models to output information we <span class="textNudge">need</span> to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism" target="_blank" alt="Determinism">deterministic</a>.
<br>Currently, no ai is deterministic,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes ... Often yielding '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)" target="_blank" alt="AI Hallucinations">hallucinations</a>', as the term for it.
<br>
<br>To me, there is a mix of Dreams and Hallucinations in AI.
<br>'Hallucinations' are misinturpreted input to the brain,
<br>'Dreams' are hallucinations the brain made itself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, for my take on it.
<br>
<br>Cause Dreams are the random firings that our brain connects to fabricate a story from the happenstance of signals.
<br>As the Cortex rolls back in functionality, decision-making drops, causing odd actions/choices in dreams.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Limbic System goes into overdrive;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hippocampus & Amygdala kickin it up a notch.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textSkew">Our Memory & Stress center, respectively.</span>
<br>
<br>Dreams are a place we simulate outcomes to scenarios,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Emotional memories are smoothed out,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concepts are conceived and broken down.
<br>I love dreaming, but I dream in black'n'white or grayscale,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a story for another blog entry.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualia is a fun topic.
<br>
<br>Weirdly, I'm trying to think of an example of a network that would generate dreams.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But all I can think of is a GAN, and that's not entirely right.
<br>I'd say, any AI that doesn't requires a "lighthouse" to guide it's learning/generation.
<br>
<br>I call it the "Lighthouse" Noise to myself,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure there is an official term for it that I never heard of.
<br>But learning and generation requires noise of some kind to instigate a pattern/prediction.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call it a "lighthouse" since it's the reference noise it had to start with initially.
<br>In many learning processes, it's a random noise pattern of some kind.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But that noise pattern must remain the same throughout the learning process.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textSkew">That's fun to mess with mid-training, by the way.</span>
<br>
<br>I wasn't a fan of that aspect of AI learning in my ESN, LSTM, and GRU networks I've built.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Feels like a needless bias that would limit possible predictions.
<br>But that's just how those networks work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Predictions are made based on the distance from their "lighthouse".
<br>
<br>If someone knows the correct term for it, I'd love to know!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I'm not going to be adding comments to my blog,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I dunno
<br>

Our brains work at "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_brain_hypothesis' target="_blank" alt='Critical Brain Hypothesis'>criticality</a>" or critical mass when awake and in REM sleep,
<br>If our brain's operate beyond critical mass, we have a seizure.
<br>If it falls below, we have a stroke or cognative issues.
<br>Our brains,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Running on the "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos' target="_blank" alt='Edge of Chaos'>edge of chaos</a>".
<br>
<br>AI is currently a similar beast,
<br>Our current fleet of AIs work at critical mass for compute,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With the target of critical mass for data flow in "thought"
<br>with added limiters/gates within LLMs to keep them from breaking themselves.
<br>
<br>Thing is, we are limited by training all ai structures too far <span class="textSkew">or</span> not far enough,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ending with an unusable model.
<br>
<br>But, to state, I'm a hobbyist ai researcher now.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Focusing on GAT networks.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mention my Boid/Crowd ai work experiance on my About Me page.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

The current holy grail is Long-term Attention to Forethought;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason & Logical breakdown of a(n) thought/action/idea, inferencing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An ai <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex' target="_blank" alt='Prefrontal Cortex'>Prefrontal Cortex</a>, if you will.
<br>Something called a "<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network' target="_blank" alt='Spiked Neural Network'>Spiked Neural Network</a>" is what we'd label our own Human Brain as.
<br>
<br>The "Spike" is basically a handshake between neuronal firings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little "hey there" back to the neuron that initiated the synaptic firing.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nitrogen playing heavily in Neuotransmitters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textSkew">If you thought of whip-its, keep that in mind for the next section</span>
<br>
<br>In current day AI, the most similar behaviour is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation'>Backpropagation</a>, but it's not the same.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's close enough we call it an analogue to spiking behaviour.
<br>
<br>Spiking behaviour is what's next for AI development,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, the behaviour that happens due to the spiking.
<br>
<br>Yet, I believe, we already have the ai neural structure to make spiking-adjacent behaviour to occur.
<br>
<br>Graph Neural Networks
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, mostly used as "Recommendation Systems" or linking <span class="textSkew">associations</span>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::nudge nudge::
<br>
<br>It has the potential to free us from needing an <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/adam-optimizer/" target="_blank" alt="Adam Optimization">Adam Optimization</a> or a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/gradient-descent" target="_blank" alt="Gradient Descent">Gradient Descent</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is where my current research is,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So take me with a grain of salt.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

In our brain's Cortex, a set <span class="textNudge">Structure</span> of neurons along with their <span class="textNudge">Activity</span> is used to determine an outcome.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course this thought has lead me to believe Deja Vu is due to found "<a href='https://medium.com/@kdorichev/edges-detection-in-computer-vision-using-convolutions-5332efad3c91' target='_blank' alt='Edge Detection'>convolved</a>" edges within the Cortex.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pulling the "edge" of a dream you had that used the same neural pathways one time weeks back.
<br>
<br>Calling it 'convoled' is a bit of a stretch,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But it makes sense to me.
<br>Sartre lumped it in with "Quasi-observation",
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing everything about something all at once.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we call it 'Deja Vu'
<br>
<br>But within the brain, are known pathways,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Deterministic pathways between non-deterministic regions.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time guiding the "simulation" of our mental frequencies of thoughts to a conclusion.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

Dynamic Graph Attention Networks ( dynamic GATs ) are the only thing that makes sense for true meta-learning
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; To me...
<br>
<br>Ya know, given what limited "classifications" I heard for "General Artificial Intelligence" recently....
<br>Fine, I'll call what I want to do "super intelligence" then, or what ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupid labels...
<br>
<br>We haven't even agree'd on what general artificial intelligence is yet,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But keep hearing weak sauce descriptions of it.
<br>Hearing it described like "GPT+" or "LLM+" .... and not something with intrinsic meta-learning build in?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't care how many hidden layers you have,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt that would ever reach general intelligence.
<br>
<br>If an AI can't generate a new thought or idea from a blank set of data,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of a "lighthouse"
<br>I'm probably not going to call it general intelligence.
<br>
<br>If the ai can't Dream, it's not general intelligence.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

The progress towards useful AI has been slow.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; For what AI can do for us today.
<br>Yet, the progress towards AI integration has been quick and dirty.
<br>
<br>We need the "<a href='https://www.allrecipes.com/article/history-of-boxed-cake-mix/' target='_blank' alt='Duff Baking Boxs'>Add the egg back to the cake recipe</a>" moment.
<br>
<br>I've using AI as individual tools for my projects,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Running individual models for specific tasks as needed.
<br>But seems most products are attempting all-in-one solutions.
<br>
<br>Best thing I've seen so far is a camera app for your phone
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That organizes your photos for you based on content in the photo
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and creates keywords from a description of the photo.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; An additive experience in life, not a replacement of a hobby or skill.
<br>
<br>
<br>Yet the rush to impress the stockholders is going to be the death of us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; People interested in a company for monetary gain,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is not going to have the best interest of the developers and consumers in mind.
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

The socialites see AI as the solution to everything,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just use some AI to solve that problem."
<br>
<br>Until whichever tomorrow it is,
<br>We'll be stuck with "adding glue to pizza" and "pregnant women should smoke 1 cigarette a day."
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In it's own way, every product that releases will have something.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why we get Video Game day-1 patches.
<br>
<br>A future time when the bottom dollar doesn't matter more than the consumers.
<br>
<br>In the mean time, we'll be punished for being online,
<br>Assaulted by the woes of the ai generative community.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bots on auto-pilot, reacting to themselves on young platforms,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because by the time a platform gets big, it'll be too late to moderate.
<br>
<br>Hacking wont stop,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm assuming people will have fun breaking anti-bot systems.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An afternoon project for the heck of it!
<br>Except now, the hacking isn't illigal,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its just social hacking using technology to operate as a person.
<br>Its the same thinking as Hacking,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in a different medium.
<br>"How do I break this system?"
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Remains the same question.
<br>If that doesn't paint me as gray-hat minded,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I dunno what will.
<br>
<br>The ai doors have been opened,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; No puttin' the blood back in the elevator now.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy'
<br>
<div class="blogSpacer"></div>

We are embracing the monetary gain from that hope of AI.
<br>Which I'm all for, but I think the path we are taking needs to be expanded further before we can continue safely.
<br>
<br>It feels like the guys that invented the wheels on ai,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Watched as their project roll out the door,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without them at the wheel.
<br>
<br>Google's <a href='https://gamengen.github.io/' target='_blank' alt='GameNGen'>GameNGen</a> and <a href='https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-2-a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/' target='_blank' alt='Genie 2'>Genie 2</a> now
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Feels more like a "We can do this, so why not?" type of projects
<br>But Google is known for exploring the unknown for fun.
