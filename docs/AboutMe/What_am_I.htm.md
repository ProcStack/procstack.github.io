      I'm given the title 'Technical Artist' (when doing real-time jobs)
      
   or 'Technical Director' (on films)
      
     or 'Creative Technologist' (for immersive)
      
It's all the same types of mental challenges though,
      
   Just in different mediums of digital graphics.

    So I says, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same color in the end.

      Ya know... I don't really know what I am,
      
   I just know I like figuring out puzzles, and for the life of me, can't seem to stop my fidgety fingers.

Always gotta be tapping away at some code, 
      
   or making particle effects,
      
   or building some diy contraption, 
      
   or 3d modeling, 
      
   or sewing, 
      
   or writing, 
      
   or ... well, you get the idea.

An undiagnosed something-or-another,
      
   Who spawned-in with the energy befitting a gift from the mythical Red Bull itself!

 Web Dev Note : I'm a 3D & Shader Technical Artist first, that brings me the most joy.
    
   JavaScript has been a personal hobby of mine for 28-29 years now,
    
   But I barely know any frameworks, only working knowledge of React & Node.js.
    
     For my projects, I make ESM modules in Native JavaScript, served using Node.js & Nginx or Plex

 I can always learn frameworks if needed.

 They're usually just a lot of bloat, so I never wanted to use them.
    
   JQuery ruined it for me hahah.

 Then after a decade, you end up with your own frameworks anyway.
    
   Let alone the NPM horror stories of packages like 'isEven()'
    
   Just use - let isEven = ( v ) => !(v & 0x0001);
    
     And call it a day!

 Bootstraps of Bootstraps of Bootstraps,
    
   Over the years, creating tools for most web, style, & network situations.

 React Native does seem cool though.
