# Init.

Ahoi there!

I'm ProcStack, Trancor, & Kevin Edzenga,

  Which ever ya feel like calling me!

I'm a technical artist with years of film, XR, & immersive experience.

Trancor is my pre-rendered graphics & diy builds,

ProcStack is coding & real-time graphics creations ('Trancor' was taken on github),

Kevin Edzenga is just ... Me.

I built this site to show off my work,

  From the site's code to it's 3d modeling, shaders, even pxlNav itself!

Everything the light touches! ...sorta.

  I didn't make Three.js, certainly.
