    <br>
    <br>Text to handwriting generator
    <br>Created to capture the personality of one of my characters, Diece; the very one who lives in the cabin of Metal-Asylum.net.
    <br>Letting them write the very words written in the tome perched upon the desk.
    <br>A segmenter, labeler, and scripting language was written to allow saving individual characters, variants, and written pages, with text effects like opacity, scale, and kearning.
    
    <br>
    <br>Scan some writing, click the letters, adjust the spacing, type your page with those letters, and hit save!
