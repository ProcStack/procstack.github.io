    The background of this page is running '<span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span>',
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; A javascript package to extend Three.js for more interactive / game like mechanics.

    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="innerCenter textBoost">
      Make scenes in any 3D CGI software,
      <br>& use pxlNav to walk through it in a browser!
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>Set up collision objects, teleporters, animated textures, items to pick up, and more,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; All by adding specific Object Groups and custom User Details to objects in your 3d modeling software.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Maya, Blender, Houdini, Cinema4D, 3DS Max, etc... )
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any software that can export FBX or GLTF / GLB
    

    <br>
    <br> Then, tell <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> to load your scene file as a <span class="textName">Room</span> 
    <br> You'll just drop in to walk around!
    <br> Or be a static camera & teleport to locations you define in your scene file.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="innerCenter">
      Install it for your web project using NPM
      <div class="textBoldBox" style="margin: 4px;">npm -i pxlnav</div>

      <br>examples are included when installed
    </div>

    <br><div class="ppnHBar"></div>
  
    <br>You can use any 3d modeling software to make interactive environments called <span class="textName">Rooms</span>, making it a little easier to make games/interactive environments.
    
    <br>
    <br>It supports rig + animation files for your character animation; and use the Animation State Machine in <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> to control which animation plays when.
    <br>
    <br>You can add a simple curve in your scene to act as a camera path,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then add another to control the camera's look-at target during the camera path animation.
    <br>
    <br> Sliding & Animated textures by using a second texture, particle effects, FPS navigation, ground collision, obstacles, items, portals, and more.

    <br>

    <br>Lets say, in Maya or Blender, you make a full scene, with lights and cameras and everything.

    <br>
    <br>You'd want to move certain things to individual groups, like "Camera", "Lights", "Colliders" & "Scene".
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then for things like instances of trees, rocks, or other objects you want to duplicate, make a group called "Instances" with the base object inside it.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, add an empty null/group with a custom string attribute 'Instance' with the name of the object in the Instances group you want to copy to that spot.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This also works with using an Object & 'Instance' attribute, it'll clone the object at every vertex of your object.

    <br>
    <br>If you're familiar with shaders for GLSL,
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the <span class="textBoldBox">Y</span> key to use the <span class="textName">Shader Editor</span> in <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span>.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That way you can easily edit your shader code, while walking around!

    <br>
    <br>You can find more details on the available custom User Detail Attributes in <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span>'s <a href="../pxlNav-docs" target="_blank" alt="pxlNav Documentation" class="textBump">Documentation</a>.
