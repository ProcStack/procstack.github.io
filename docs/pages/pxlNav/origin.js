      Originally <span class="textNudge">pxlNav</span> was made for a virtual event space named "Antibody Club" [defunct] during 2020 Covid lockdowns.
      <br>Hosted virtual events, album releases, dj sets, & holiday parties while we couldn't in meat space.

      <br>
      <br>Run around as a display of your webcam, chat with others within a visible distance, grab some items to get "effects" and explore a couple different artist's created environments.

      <br>
      <br>But since then, society walked back into the sun and stretched their legs a bit,
      <br>The needs for a virtual event space had waned.
      
      <br>
      <br>However, pxlNav was pretty cool, so I decided to make it easier to install for your own Three.js projects.
      <br>Aiming to turn your 3d modeling software into a level editor.

      <br><br>As it stands, pxlNav supports FBX files for your Rooms (the environment / scene / levels) which can be made in your 3D program of choice.
      <br>It supports rig + animation fbx files for your character animation, and a simple curve in your scene can act as your camera path ( add another if you want the camera to look somewhere as it's traveling the path ).
      <br>Animated textures by using a second texture, particle effects, FPS navigation, obstacles, items, portals, and more.

      <br><br>3d for web has come a far way, and it has less hurdles than getting your game ready for cross platform usability.
      <br>Websites are just there, anywhere, and can be turned into apps easily these days.
      <br>So why not?

      During the run of Antibody Club (2020), I had a helping hand on a couple shaders, camera animations, and some other odds'n'ends. 
      <br>Much of which has been updated since, wanted to give my thanks never-the-less!

      So, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention <span class="textNudge">Michael Lee</span> & <span class="textNudge">Charles Wang</span> for helping on Antibody Club / pxlNav.
