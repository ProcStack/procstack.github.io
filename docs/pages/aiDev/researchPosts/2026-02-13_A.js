  I'm rummaging through Nietzsche & Schopenhauer a little more.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was something from Schopenhauer that stuck out,

  <br><br> <span class="innerCenter"><span class="textBump textName">
  All willing springs from lack,
  <br>from deficiency,
  <br>and thus from suffering.</span>
  <br> <span class="textShrink">[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation" target="_blank">The World as Will and Representation</a>, Volume I]</span></span>

  <br> Now, I'm not much of a pessimist ...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a bit closer to whatever Nietzsche is...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still don't know, he was like a transcendentally existential nihilist.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm a pragmatist in a post-daoist world.

  <br><br> But Will isn't something I thought of as being Lack of something.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It makes sense though,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's one of those phrases you could shrug off with a "sure."

  <br><br> So, let's give it a moment of our time --

  <br><br> I like to create for the love of creating.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Schopenhauer might say it's for the lack of those "feel good" feelings I get while making something.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which I can't logically argue with, so I'll accept as true for now.

  <br><br> But is the desire to be entertained from the lack of action in life?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or forced responsibilities in our day-to-days, so a lack of leisure?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textShrink">[Seneca throwback, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_(Seneca)" target="_blank">On The Shortness of Life</a>]</span>

  <br><br> I could argue, with Seneca and eastern concepts in mind, that;
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Work should come Rest,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With Rest should come Work.

  <br><br> It would depend on your definition of rest,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Play, beer with friends, book in your comfy chair;
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick the right marshmallow for you!

  <br><br> Then you could argue Hegel might say that life doesn't exist until there is Lack,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus leading to Want.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So existence can't be defined until Lack is imparted.

  <br><br> Hmmm,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; What made prokaryotes move in the first place 3.8 billion years ago?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; What made eyes evolve?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; What made those cave scorpions genetically lose their eyes and most of their stingers?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion" target="_blank">Pseudoscorpions</a>]

  <br><br> <span class="textItch">That I can breath, I must live...</span>

  <br><br> Maybe Want vs Stimulus is one in the same?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you keep doing something over and over, you get good at it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you keep getting tapped on the head with a spoon, you'll ask the kid to stop.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you sit on your ass for years 'n years after being physically fit in your youth, you won't be for long.

  <br><br> Maybe it's a bit middle of the road,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But mutual growth seems to be a common factor here.

  <br><br> Am I arguing for some form of Lamarckian Evolution? No.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetic</a> gene activations do occur in our lives.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survival of the fittest gene activation!

  <br><br> Muahah!
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll middle of the road anything!!

  <br><br> <span class="textItalic">Umm...</span>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it worse to be pragmatically wrong? 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to follow an incorrect path in hindsight?

  <br><br> As with all of these posts,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; On this diegetically connected blog,

  <br><br> I've been adding in my latent adversarial-projection "enforcement."
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, a system to verify signals in the brain before processing is complete.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textShrink">(Similar to layers of the cerebral cortex; hypocampus' influence in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd layers & amygdala's 1st, 2nd, 4th influence; out of 6 layers)</span>

  <br><br> I was thinking that having sporadic activations at my input would cause echos throughout my network.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I could simulate input data,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="textItalic">Dreams</span>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And adhere to the Defensive Activation Theory in the brain for edge re-wiring in my network.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8176926/" target="_blank">Defensive Activation</a> is proposed as a method our brains use to limit important neural pathways from changing due to neural plasticity while we sleep.

  <br><br> In my mind,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing it's simulated/fake data could help from self-reinforcement of incorrect ideas and ideals from "adversarial" input data, like "Real" data in a GAN.

  <br><br> Much like my middle of the roadness for accepting a black'n white truth,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an adverserial advantage.

  <br><br> An update on the training,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm running into some slight issues training locomotion separate from other inputs in the brain. 
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I'm attempting to restrain areas of the brain for learning specific things,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to releasing those "guided" regions.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing the final brain to be defined, before diffusing with itself, to then learn better pathways in the full brain.

  <br><br> I could let it learn everything at once, at run time, but
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; .... Pre-training is useful ....
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ::sigh::

  <br><br> Slap an ai into a robot with some motors and sensors, no server connection, senses being flooded all at once;
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good & Bad feedback being lost in an orchestra of signals.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the transformer being tongue-tied until the brain catches up.
  
  <br><br> ...You'd want it to have some idea of how to use the mech it's in,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or it'll be flopping around on its stomach for a few weeks. 
  
  <br><br> So I'm making my playground in Unity, likely set up some .net connection to my training server for virtual device feedback.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I can train it all at once,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'm just not thinking about it in the right way yet.

  <br><br> But hey, WebSocket over local network in Unity sounds like a fun project to make!
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Asynchronous training of one AI model at home between multiple computers,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This'll be fun!


  <br><br><br><div class='procPagesAIDevBar'></div>


  <br><br> Luckily neural projection + geometry can be moved between models,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ...If I have this right in my transformer layer...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a organ doner,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just without the lifelong immune suppressants.

  <br><br> Stimulation based,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Not training based.
