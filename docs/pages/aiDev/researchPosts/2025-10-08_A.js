  Since we don't have a ton to go off of for Aptitude,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides state testing, and grades in school,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the whole of the animal kingdom,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And behavioural studies...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, like, thats it?
  
  <br><br> I kid; seriously, what qualifies as Aptitude in an AI?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it how well it trains?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it how well it does a task?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; How well it can do various tasks?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; How well it can do a brand new task its never seen?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; How well it can learn patterns that evade humans?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; How fast it can learn?
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; How fast it can predict?

  <br><br> All valid marks of Aptitude.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I feel Purpose is pretty important for Aptitude.

  <br><br> Do we actually need it to be AI?
  <br> Or is AI just the new thing, and there's open-source programs already to do the task?

  <br> As humans, we have hobbies and interests when we feel lost.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might not be what government officials tell us,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That people are nothing without a job.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thing is... nothingness physically hurts.
  
  <br><br> People on their own, make their own purpose.

  <br><br>Bordom helps us find purpose.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet in this ever connected world, bordom is harder to find...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class='textBump'>Let yourself be bored!!</span>

  <br><br> A suggestion to find bordom,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't bring your phone to the bathroom.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heck, Scrubs had an entire episode glorifying the 'Throne' and it's inspiration!!

  <br><br><div class='procPagesAIDevBar'></div>

  <br> Should you feel lost and/or no purpose,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel exploring creation to any capacity helps me.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might be as useful as skin salve, but it could help you find new perspectives.

  <br><br> Make something new, even if it's just a doodle.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Write a poem, even if it's just a haiku.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Build a model, even if it's just a paper airplane.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Cook a meal, even if it's just scrambled eggs.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply try something unique to you.

  <br><br> And if all else fails, I think Robert D. Putnam's 'Bowling Alone' shines a bright light on loneliness.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Putnam wrote about the "lack of 3rd places" to use a modern turn-of-phrase.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He talked about the lack of community spaces, and how that leads to loneliness.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; That community helps fill the need for purpose.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it's joining a bowling league, book club, co-op garden, or a church.

  <br> People often compare Stoicism to Existentialism.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If not conflating Stoicism with Existentialism entirely,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is a disservice to both philosophies...

  <br><br> Where Existentialism is about controlling your life,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; To stranglehold your existence,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Molding life to your will.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often accredited to Soren Kierkegaard & Jean-Paul Sartre.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say Nietzsche too, but he's often labeled Nihilist, yet his conclusions sounded more Existentialist to me.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Society doesn't exist without structure? Sounds Existentialist to me.
  
  <br><br> I feel it takes a strong mind & will-power to attain Existentialism,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I'd also be VERY worried by a person who thinks they can control everything in life.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism</a> )

  <br><br> While Stoicism is about accepting what life gives you,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; And being in control of how you respond to it.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often accredited to Marcus Aurelius & Seneca.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism</a> )

  <br><br> Honestly, Stoicism is quite appealing, because we can't control everything in life.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; But, if you're not aware, the online 'Red Pill' community has turned Stoicism into a toxic mindset.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is often where I hear the conflation of Stoicism and Existentialism.
  
  <br><br> The core idea of the 'Red Pill' or Manosphere is to learn confidence and realizing you are your own person.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue that arrose in the Manosphere, was when men started blaming their problems on women. Which lead to try-hards deciding women needed to be taken down a peg or two.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Andrew Tate is not a good person...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoicism was an established idea in the community, but then it was twisted to justify misogyny and toxic masculinity.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...and, as always, someone trying to make a buck off the situation.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the begining, the message was "don't change yourself for others, be confident in who you are."
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there went that...
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere</a> )

  <br> I think of myself as an Absurdist,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Albert Camus' "The Myth of Sisyphus"
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One must imagine Sisyphus happy"
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no purpose in life,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then what we do in life gives it purpose.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus" target="_blank">wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus</a> )

  <br><br> To me, Absurdism is more realistic.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we can find purpose in the absurdity of life.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we believe there is no meaning to life itself.

  <br><br> Absurdism inevitably leads to the expected mindset of Stoicism,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accepting what life gives you, and you need to be in control of how you respond to it.
  
  <br><br> If we think life is inherently meaningless, then hardships can be seen objectively.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Something bad didn't happen to you specifically, it was just the luck of the draw.

  <br><br>So get up, dust yourself off, and try again.

  <br><br><div class='procPagesAIDevBar'></div>

  <br> I think all of this shows that Aptitude has to do with interpretation of life itself.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; For an AI, I think if it can find purpose, it can find Aptitude.

  <br><br> If an AI were to follow the path of Absurdity without influence from life itself,
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; It would likely see life and lives as inherently meaningless.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is bad, very bad.

  <br><br> My lived experiences helped give Absurdity meaning to me.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; The things I've done, how others reacted, how I've felt about it after the fact.

  <br><br> Teaching an AI about Cause-and-Effect would be a foundational path to seed -
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaninglessness has Meaning.
