    The game jam was a collab jam, primarily consisting of 3 of us doing art and programming for Currents of War.
    
   I helped out doing the primary art and game's look, while another two did the programming and some art assets.

 I set up the shop, drew all the items, ui, and the characters,
    
   I also wrote the code + shaders to handle animation & dynamically coloring the character's faces, hair, & armor.

 For the art inspiration, I pulled from -
    
   Gameboy Advance games like Zelda Minish Cap,
    
   Super Nintendo games like Secret of Mana & Final Fantasy 3/6,
    
   And Original Nintendo games like River City Ransom.

 I wanted to create a semi 'tacky' weapons shop for the style.
    
   To give some room for gags & chicanery!

 One of the challenges was making sure the character's displayed with custom colors for their hair, face, armor, gloves/boots, and leggings.
    
   I wrote a shader to handle the colorization of the character's face, hair, and armor.
    
   Along with the sprite animation system to handle the character's idle, walk, and talk animations.
    
   I also wrote a custom editor script to allow the character's colors to be changed in Unity's Editor, and have it update in real-time.

 Among other fun things like adding an animated cursor, outlines around items on hover, ui borders that auto size to the text and stay pixel perfect, among other things

    Give the game a try, it's a little game with some neat mechanics!
    
   Try to make as much money as you can off these heroes coming to your shop!
