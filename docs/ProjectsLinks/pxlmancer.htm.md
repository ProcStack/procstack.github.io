    A full drawing/painting app on desktop, a fun fidget toy on mobile.
    
Languages - JavaScript & JQuery

    On'n'off multi-year project to make a full fledge drawing site with layer support, brush types, vector tools, brush effects (cpu based pixel effects, this was pre-learning about opengl shaders or webgl)

    Use the mixing pallet to blend colors together to paint with, then save the pallet by pressing a number key.
      
All of which can be saved to a .pxlm file; to store your layers, settings, and pallet swatches!

   Sadly, an update in javascript broke saving images, and I haven't had the time to fix it yet...
    
You'll need to drag the image from the "Save Image" screen to a new tab to view and save it.
    
But you can easily save your document to a pxlm file, and open it back up to continue working on your project!

   A little tid-bit, pxlmancer.com is the origin of my 'pxl' namespace for my projects.
    
It's my indicator of a codebase with a visual output; such as pxlNav, pxlVisualizer, pxlTextGenerator, etc.
