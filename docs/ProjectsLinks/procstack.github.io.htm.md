Language - JavaScript

    Eyyyyy, check out this sites code!
    
   It mostly has examples of pxlNav rooms and the page & content system I wrote

It's funny, out of all the projects I can bootstrap together with my personal boilerplates over the years,
    
   I never built a single-page site system before this one.

Maybe I should write a 'server-side' pre-render for this pages system,
    
   Turn this into a proper framework for others to use! haha

I like vanilla javascript too much....
    
   Its a detriment realy, but I can't help it!

So soooo many years using JS on its own,
    
   Environments like React.js/Next.js, Svelte, Angular, etc. don't feel like as much fun as just writing it out myself, dang it!
    
     Ragga fragga, get off my lawn ya dang kids!
