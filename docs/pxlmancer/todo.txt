	--- Done
~ Add [xn,yn] textfield to Shape Tool
~ Make UI more grey

####--- Time Consuming To-Do's
+ Mobile Menu UI Remake
 - Build menu into tables
 - Populate options buttons
+Begin ThreeJS composite passes / general openGL effects
  - Convert Intro to OpenGL
  - Convert Filters to OpenGL
  - Prep ThreeJS, convert menthods to custome written webGL later
  -| Is there a simpler, cheaper, way to run OpenGL ES for pixel processing?
-Boost SEO
  + Submit to Google Play Store
  + Submit to Apple Store
    -| Whats needed for this?
    -| Are progressive web apps enough?
  - Ads on Menu Windows
    -| When menus slide up, slide up leaderboard ad?
    -| Feature unlock for pay for version?
      - Can't think of any good reasoning for this
         Open Source damn it! Or at least, not money driven
  -| Would external companies assist in anyway where sitemaps and meta tags do not?
  -| Page updates vs submitting new app version?
    - I'd imagine any updates for JS Workers to allow for progressive web apps to update
       should also be updated on the Play Store
+Prevent 2 finger zoom on Mobile
 - Convert to 2 finger zoom, rotate, pan
 - Options slide in for locking zoom, rotate, pan
    slide back after couple seconds
 - Convert 3 finger tap to clear screen

####--- Easier To-Do's
-Latch scroll menu drag, prevent pop within distance delta < mag latch
-Generic pulldown menu element
  -| How is the Color Mode menu set up?
