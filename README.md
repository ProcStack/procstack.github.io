## NodeJS app with pxlNav navigation framework for three.js

Metown USA, baby!


I decided to release the pxlNav framework for three.js I wrote for use in the website `Antib0dy.club`,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;A site used during the height of the pandemic to throw virtual parties & dj album releases.

I wrote a first person navigation system, collision detection, camera-on-rail animation sequencer,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;An in-browser opengl vert/frag shader code text editor & compiler/refresher with keyboard shortcut regex commands,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;FBX 3d scene structure to allow for Maya/Blender directly into pxlNav with complete scene comprehension.

All as a framework using three.js with differed render passes to allow for in-environment items
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Which could alter the screens appearance through post processing,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or added screen effects when using teleportation pads
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between like-named collider+object pairs in the FBX scene file

But I did remove the Jitsi integration of users webcams and mics
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Implemented as their video visual avitar & audio with distance fall off attenuation.
<br/>This is too much of a separate intergration to include in this repo, nor the pxlNav repo (when its created)
<br/>It will need to have a docker script, websocket settings,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Port forwarding, sip controlling, handshake handling,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Room management overhaul, more asset & user managament checks, added security;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An entire environment to set up
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'll likely make a pxlVideoAvitar repo in the future,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are no plans for that at the moment.

Realistically, this scene comprehension should be migrated over to support Universal Scene Description (USD) for the future advancements to the system.

But heck with it, for now I'm making a rabbit druid dude poke a fire and look at a stick for my website!
