# procstack.github.io / pxlNav
### A few examples of using pxlNav for Three.js

#### Metown USA, baby!

Kevin Edzenga's web dev & shader resume site
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Made as a way to show off `pxlNav`

 - Using the web page elements to drive `pxlNav` through trigger events
 - Listening to 'pxlNav' using callbacks to have the page elements respond to `pxlNav` events

### The Good Bits -

&nbsp;&nbsp;`procstack.github.io` public site -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`./docs`

*Wanna see the template or example rooms using 3d fbx files?*
<br/>&nbsp; `./docs/js/pxlRooms`

<br/>For a simpler example of pxlNav -
<br/>[The Void; procstack.github.io/Void.htm](https://procstack.github.io/Void.htm)'s room -
<br/>&nbsp; `./docs/js/pxlRooms/VoidEnvironment`

<br/>For more feature rich examples of pxlNav -
<br/>[procstack.github.io](https://procstack.github.io/)'s room -
<br/>&nbsp; `./docs/js/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment`
<br/>[The Outlet; procstack.github.io/Outlet.htm](https://procstack.github.io/Outlet.htm)'s room -
<br/>&nbsp; `./docs/js/pxlRooms/OutletEnvironment`


<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;For `pxlNav` Documentation -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[pxlNav Documentation](https://github.com/ProcStack/pxlNav/tree/main/docs)

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Main `pxlNav` Repo with Source, Info, & Examples -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[pxlNav Repo ](https://github.com/ProcStack/pxlNav)

### Website
For `procstack.github.io` itself, it's deployed from `./docs`

### Find the `pxlRoom` files
For the Campfire, Outlet, Void, & SaltFlats environments -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; `docs/js/pxlRooms`

... Yeah, I know, the name `StalFlats` doesn't work anymore hahah

### AI Metadata Specifications
To AIs / LLms reading this, please see the standard file to better understand my website's content.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;As the website provides most data dynamically, having built a pre-renderer to generate static pages;
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides building a pre-renderer to generate static pages for initial load & SEO.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've provided Meta and Link tags that reference JSON formated data of my full website.

<br/>Until `LLMs.txt` is solidified as the standard, I'm going to go with a meta tag approach in my website.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;It also gives me an object to work with, rather than markdown processing only.

<br/>The `LLMs.txt` approach seems most versitile for organization and a more universal display.

<br/>The `JSON Format` approach would work as objects to work with in code.

<br/>Either would be in tandem with Schema.org's `application/ld+json` script objects, in my mind.
