      I'm given the title 'Technical Artist' (when doing real-time jobs)
      
   or 'Technical Director' (on films)
      
     or 'Creative Technologist' (for immersive)
      
It's all the same types of mental challenges though,
      
   Just in different mediums of digital graphics.

    So I says, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same color in the end.

      Ya know... I don't really know what I am,
      
   I just know I like figuring out puzzles, and for the life of me, can't seem to stop my fidgety fingers.

Always gotta be tapping away at some code, 
      
   or building some diy contraption, 
      
   or 3d modeling, 
      
   or sewing, 
      
   or writing, 
      
   or ... well, you get the idea.
