# Neurous.Net :: Particles App

[Neurous.Net](http://neurous.net/) 2014-2025

    Language - JavaScript

    More fun on phone!

 Some browsers may alert you of the site being unsecure, http
    
   You can try [procstack.github.io/NeurousNet](../NeurousNet/index.htm) instead.

 A few day project to learn Canvas in HTML5, 2014.
    
   Make a custom emitter and particle class structure in javascript;
    
     Just a page you can play around with some particles.

 On desktop,
    
   Left-Click to grab near by particles.
    
   Right-Click to pull in all the particles!
    
   Middle-Click to spawn a black hole!

 On mobile,
    
   Tap & drag to grab near by particles.
    
   Tap & hold to pull in all the particles!
    
   Tap with two fingers to spawn a black hole!
    
     Here's a tip, hold one finger down, and tap with the second to spawn them in faster!

 Just a note, clicking will spawn in 2 new particles as well,
    
   Your screen will fill eventually!
    
     It's fun heheh

 Enjoy!

 The site was bootstrapped from pxlmancer, hence the similar style.

 Originally written in Functional JavaScript before Classes existed,
    
   The trick was reading function elements on the dictionary object from within the dictionary variable.
    
     Some make-shift 'Methods' on a 'Class' object

 Also adding Prototypes to a custom function,
    
   Which could have just been a class.

 Functional Native JavaScript, gotta love it
    
   Luckily, times have changed!

 Rewritten in 2021 to use Classes, added basic WebGL features (glow), and cleaned up movement logic.
    
   Then 2024-2025 to add more WebGL support, better generalization, and visual features.

 When you've been using JavaScript for decades,
    
   Looking back at an old project,
    
     Not only do you get to read your bad old code,
    
     But also the lack of basic JavaScript features hahah.

 No let, no const, no class, no arrow functions, no ... array spread operator, 
    
   Heck, Array.forEach() actually exists now!
