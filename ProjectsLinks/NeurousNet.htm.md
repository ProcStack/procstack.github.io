   You can try [neurousnet/index.htm](../neurousnet/index.htm) instead.

     A few day project.
    
   Just a page you can play around with particles.  A random project to make a custom emitter and particle class structure in javascript.

 Tap & drag to grab near by particles.
    
   Tap & hold to pull in all the particles!
    
      (Or Right-Click & drag with a mouse)

Tap with two fingers to spawn a black hole!
    
  (Or Middle-Click with a mouse)
    
   Here's a tip, hold one finger down, and tap with the second to spawn them in faster!

 Enjoy!
