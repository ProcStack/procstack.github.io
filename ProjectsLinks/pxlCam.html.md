   - The grid toggles the overlay you can use to align and position your shot

   - Tap & drag left/right or up/down to change the current filter's hue shifting or edge detection size & brightness

 Each filter has a different effect for the finger drag + direction, so play around with it!

 This is a camera filter web site I wrote with interactive color and edge effects opengl shaders,

 I've added camera checks + access, resolution checkings + switching
      
   The photo-bin temp photo storage handling. Once you take a photo, a thumbnail will appear.  Tap the icon to load a screen to save the image to any number of resoultions. Tap a resolution to load the file size, if you want to send the photo on discord or something.
