    Eyyyyy, check out this sites code!
    
   It mostly has examples of pxlNav rooms and the page & content system I wrote

It's funny, out of all the projects I can bootstrap together with my personal boilerplates over the years,
    
   I never built a single-page site system before this one.

Maybe I should write a 'server-side' pre-render for this pages system,
    
   Turn this into a proper framework for others to use! haha

Update : I did do that ...
    
   It helps a ton to quickly render the dynamically generated pages into static pages,
    
     Then build out the sitemap.xml and llms.txt + htm.md files for SEO and LLM crawling.
    
   There are still some bugs in it, but I'm working on fixing them.
    
     See the ./packing/renderStaticPages.mjs script for more details.

I like vanilla javascript too much....
    
   Its a detriment for getting a React/Next job, but I can't help it!

So soooo many years using JS on its own,
    
   I started messing with it in 1996 for my GeoCities Dragon Ball Z fan website,
    
     Making an image gallery for my first script from an example, age 10.
    
   So environments like React.js/Next.js, Svelte, Angular, etc. don't feel as fun as just writing it out myself, dang it!
    
     Ragga fragga, get off my lawn ya dang kids!
