Text to handwriting generator
    
Language - Python & PyQt

    Created to capture the personality of one of my characters, Diece; the very one who lives in the cabin of Metal-Asylum.net.
    
   Letting them write the very words written in the tome perched upon the desk.

A segmenter, labeler, and scripting language was written to allow saving individual characters, variants, and written pages, with text effects like opacity, scale, and kearning.

Scan some writing, click the letters, adjust the spacing, type your page with those letters, and hit save!

Now with ai resources so prevelant,
    
   I've been on and off developing a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to generate new characters based on the ones you have saved.
    
   Along with a much better segmenter, where the letters will highlight as you hover over them, and you can select the ones you want to save.

This is pretty low on my project list, so it may take awhile before the support is fully working and implemented.
