 The game jam was a collab jam, primarily consisting of 3 of us doing art and programming for Currents of War.
    
   _ ellipsis9 - Programming; Background-Battle Logic using character/enemy stats like a RPG, and more
    
   _ F2ptach  - Programming & some Art assets; Events Handling, Player Input, and more
    
   _ ProcStack(me) - Art & Visual Programming; character state machine shader, shop & item art, ui, and more

    I set up the shop, the adjustable ui, animated cursor, characters, animations, and drew the items & most of the shop assets with help on a couple of 'em by F2ptach.
    
   I also wrote the code + shaders to handle animation & dynamically coloring the character's faces, hair, & armor.

 For the art inspiration, I looked to -
    
   Gameboy Advance games like Zelda Minish Cap,
    
     Everything should be outlined with similar color hues blended!
    
   Super Nintendo games like Secret of Mana & Final Fantasy 3/6,
    
     Fantasy character designs with reason for the details
    
   And Original Nintendo games like River City Ransom.
    
     Character proportions & vibes.

 I wanted to create a semi 'tacky' weapons shop for the style.
    
   To give some room for gags & chicanery!

    I drew up most of the shop assets & many items done in a single night,
    
   Just had some [chiptune fusion](https://ex-lyd.bandcamp.com/album/till-sunrise) tunes blasting and my huion screen-table going in photoshop.
    
     Yes... I realize my age, but old habbits!
    
   Felt good getting into pixel art, I've never done much of it before.
    
     Was like my highschool photoshop exploration years all over again,
    
       But a new musician this time.

   yeah photoshop for pixel art
    
     pencil & mask layers
    
       use what you know best!

 Then I isolated all the limbs & body parts of the characters on different layers in photoshop,
    
   And used the Puppet Tool in After Effects to animate the idle breathe, walking, & talking cycles.
    
     Exporting in Draft mode to keep no anti-aliasing on the pixel art.
    
   After Effects let me quickly animate & adjust without drawing out each frame.

 One of the challenges was making sure the character's displayed with custom colors for their hair, face, armor, gloves/boots, and leggings.
    
   I wrote a shader to handle the colorization of the character's face, hair, and armor.
    
   Along with the sprite animation system to handle the character's idle, walk, and talk animations.
    
     Running individual animation cycles/clips at their own FPS rates.
    
   Neeing to write a custom editor script to allow the character's colors to be changed in Unity's Editor/Viewport,
    
     And have it update in real-time for easier character creation.

 Among other fun things like adding an animated cursor, outlines around items on hover, ui borders that auto size to the text and stay pixel perfect, among other things

    Give the game a try, it's a little game with some neat mechanics!
    
   Try to make as much money as you can off these heroes coming to your shop!
