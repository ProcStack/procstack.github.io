Room & Environment Requirements --

You're main room javascript must be named how it is used in `pxlNav.js`
To start you're development, use this premade room for an example structure.


Make a back-up of the `CampfireEnvironment.js` file,
  Then start here for any modifications made in your testing.

To stop pxlNav from loading this room environment,
  Change the `startingRoom` variable in `./Source/js/pxlNav.js`
	  To your desired room name -
     `const startingRoom = "CampfireEnvironment";`

Reminder, room folders and their environment.js file must be named the same -
  `./Source/js/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment`
	  -- and --
  `./Source/js/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment/CampfireEnvironment.js`
