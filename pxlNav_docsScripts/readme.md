# pxlNav Docs
### January 1st 2024

Here you'll find scene files, scripts, heirachy needs, and other supportive information to help create your own pxlNav environment in browser.

Folders -
`docs` - pxlNav documentation


`utils` - scripts & tools to aid in pxlNav prep
<br/>Since Maya & Houdini were the primary programs used in development of the initial pxlNav pipeline, most scripts/tools are written in MEL and Vex/HOM Python. Specifications for Blender, Cinema4D, and other 3d programs can reference the `user-details` attributes in the docs,
You'll need to manually add those attributes in your program of choice.
