Who am I?

Eyo, I'm known by ProcStack, Trancor, or Kevin Edzenga
Nice to meet ya!

I like coming up with solutions to computer graphics issues
Plus make websites, DIY, & bout anything visual.

Currently my focus has been on GPU ussage.
OpenGL, GLSL, and the different shader stages.
Having been working on a project requiring,
  An opengl engine from the ground up.
Currently set private, but set up through python.

You might be able to assume why "python"
With AI becoming readily available,
I've been making a bunch of projects including it,
While they have been for myself so far,
Nothing has been made public on my github.
Maybe shortly,
But there are better resources than me out there.
