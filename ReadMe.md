### The included `pxlRoom` example files-
For the `Campfire`, `SaltFlats`, `Outlet`, & `Void` environments -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; `./js/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment` - *Static Camera*
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A campfire in the woods; with Rabbit Druid stoking the flames, while keeping an eye out.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; `./js/pxlRooms/SaltFlatsEnvironment` - *Static Camera*
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stepped-Basins of salt and brine; with a roaming Rabbit Druid traveling far.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; `./js/pxlRooms/OutletEnvironment` - *Free-Roam Camera*
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A water side coast with a lighthouse on lookout.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; `./js/pxlRooms/VoidEnvironment` - *Free-Roam Camera*
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An empty void except for the hangout essentials; a sofa, couch, and a couple brews.

... Yeah, I know, the name `StalFlats` doesn't really work anymore hahah
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; The design changed a couple times.

And the Rabbit Druid is in `./js/pxlAssets/RabbitDruidA`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; They are still in fbx format, I need to convert them to GLB with Draco compression
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I added GLTF support to pxlNav v1.0
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really should name the bugger, if he's the mascot.
