Room & Environment Requirements --

You're main room javascript must be named how it is used in `pxlNav.module.js`
<br/>To start you're development, use this premade room for an example structure.


Make a back-up of the `CampfireEnvironment.js` file,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then start here for any modifications made in your testing.

To stop pxlNav from loading this room environment,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Change the `startingRoom` variable in `./src/js/pxlNav.js`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To your desired room name -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`const startingRoom = "CampfireEnvironment";`

Reminder, room folders and their environment.js file must be named the same -
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`./Public/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment`
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- and --
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`./Public/pxlRooms/CampfireEnvironment/CampfireEnvironment.js`
